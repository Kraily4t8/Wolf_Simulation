# Wolf_Simulation
Wolf Simulation for University of Washington Tacoma TCSS435: Artificial Intelligence. Goal of project is to modify the <a href="https://github.com/algorithm0r/WolfPack">provided simulation</a> to run a research experiment. We intend to run an experiment about predator herding behaviors by adjusting the decision weights on predators.

The simulation has been updated to include multiple sliders for adjusting behaviors of predators and prey, as well as updating the included code to the modern js object notation.
